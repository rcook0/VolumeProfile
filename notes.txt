Core Concepts of Volume Profile

Point of Control (POC):
The price level where the highest traded volume occurred (fair value).

Often acts as a magnet in ranging markets.

Strong rejection from POC can signal trend continuation.

High Volume Nodes (HVN):
Areas with lots of activity ‚Äî stable zones where price consolidates.

Good for mean-reversion trades.

Often act like support/resistance.

Low Volume Nodes (LVN):
Areas with little activity ‚Äî ‚Äúthin‚Äù zones.

Price tends to pass quickly through these (‚Äúvolume gaps‚Äù).

Can be breakout or fade levels.

Value Area (VA):
The 70% of volume around POC.

Trading inside VA ‚Üí equilibrium.

Breakouts beyond VA ‚Üí imbalance / trend opportunity.

üìà Strategy Archetypes

Here are some ways to turn this into rules:

1. Value Area Rotation (Mean Reversion)

If price enters the Value Area from above ‚Üí short targeting POC.

If price enters from below ‚Üí long targeting POC.

Works best in ranging conditions.

2. Value Area Breakout (Trend)

Price breaks and closes above VAH (Value Area High) ‚Üí long.

Price breaks and closes below VAL (Value Area Low) ‚Üí short.

Works best in trending conditions.

Add filter with VWAP, session open, or higher timeframe trend.

3. POC Rejection

If price touches POC and immediately rejects with high momentum ‚Üí take trade away from POC.

Target VA extremes or LVNs.

4. LVN Break + Retest

Price breaks through a Low Volume Node ‚Üí wait for retest.

Trade in direction of breakout, targeting next HVN.

üõ† Filters & Enhancements

Session Profiles: Use separate profiles for London, NY, Asia.

Multi-timeframe: Overlay daily profiles on intraday charts.

Confluence: Align with VWAP, trendlines, moving averages, or order flow.

News filter: Volume Profile strategies can fail during high-impact events.

Risk management: Because VP levels are strong, you can often place tight stops behind LVN or just beyond VAH/VAL.

‚ö° Example Trade Logic (Pseudocode)
If price closes above Value Area High
   and higher timeframe trend is bullish:
       Buy
       SL = below VAL
       TP = next HVN or xR multiple
